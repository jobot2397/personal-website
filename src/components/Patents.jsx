        <p className="text-md">As an intern at JPMorgan, I participated in a firm-wide hackathon where a team had a week to bring an idea to the demo stage. I joined a team who's goal was to visualize stock and general market trends in virtual reality. I primarily worked on data visualization using three.js. The result from the week, was a second place finish along with a filed patent.</p>

      <p className="text-md"> These patents describe a method and design for automating an engine oil change but could be adapted to change any fluid. The crux of this design relies on a custom bolt which incorporates a ball value inside the bolt to allow drainage and filling of oil through one point all while being a beacon for the robot to locate. I primarly worked on while I was a sophomore in high school and often think about but have yet to find a business model that makes sense. I learned a lot during this exerpience not just about the patent process but in general how to explain something both percisely to a patent lawyer and then simply to people who were curious.</p>
